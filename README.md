# Anurag Verma's Portfolio

Built with **React.js** for handling the user interface, **Three.js** for rendering 3D elements, and styled with **TailwindCSS**, the 3D Minimalistic portfolio is a website project. The primary goal is to demonstrate the developer's skills in a unique manner that creates a lasting impact.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Landing Page**: Includes a `HackerRoom` GLB model (1.4 MB, Draco-compressed) with additional 3D elements like a spinning cube, rings, and React logo.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries and dynamic sizing.
- **Performance Optimized**: Mobile-friendly with Draco compression, reduced DPR, and lightweight rendering settings.
- **Tech Stack**: React.js, Three.js, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, and Tailwind CSS.
